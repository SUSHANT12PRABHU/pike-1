Things that can go wrong when compiling with rntcl and VC6:

You run init_nt but nothing seems to happend:

        For reasons no one has cared to check you need to 
        "export SHELL=bash".

Linker can't find BINMODE.OBJ:

        You haven't included VC98/lib in the linker path, aka "lib" in
        your ".init_ntrc".

Popups on the Windows machine saying things like "The application has
failed to start because foo.dll was not found.":

        The DLLs must be in the system path. Copy them from your pike
        installation dir to \windows\.

How do you start pike in the VC6 debugger?

        msdev pike.exe [pike arguments]

        Set up breakpoints in Edit -> Breakpoints (or Alt+F9) and run
        with Build -> Start Debug -> Go (or F5).

Running the SDK setup.bat results in the message "\Microsoft was
unexpected at this time.":

        You probably have your SDK in "\Program Files(x86)\..." and
        the paratheses screw up the program flow unless quoted. For
        MSSDK Feb 2003 Find the line 
        'set Path=%MSSdk%\Bin\WinNT\NT4;%Path%' and put proper quotes
        around the path.

        There is also a more general fix for this suggested on
        http://mark.santaniello.net/archives/223:

        setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
        set FIXED=
        FOR %%I IN ("%PATH:;=" "%") do (
            set FIXED=!FIXED!%%~fsI;
        )
        for %%D in (a) do (
            endlocal
            set PATH=%FIXED%
        )

VC Service Pack to program mapping:
