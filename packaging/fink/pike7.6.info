Description: Programming language with a C-like syntax
DescDetail: <<
 Pike is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language. 
 It looks a bit like C and C++, but it is much easier to learn and use. It 
 can be used for small scripts as well as for large programs. 
 
 Pike is 
 - High-level and powerful, which means that even very complex 
  things are easy to do.
 - Object-oriented, which means that you can use modern programming
  techniques to divide a large program into  small pieces, which are much
  easier to write than it would be to write 
  the entire program at once.
 - Interpreted, which means that you don't have to wait for a program to
  compile and link when you want to run it,
 - One of the fastest "scripting" languages available.
 - Garbage-collected, which makes programming much simpler, and removes 
  the risk for memory leaks and other memory-related bugs.
 - Easy to extend, which means that you can create plug-ins, written in
  Pike as well as in C or C++, and integrate them with the rest of Pike.
