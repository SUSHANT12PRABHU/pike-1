FreeBSD port for Pike
---------------------

Just copy the directory pike74 to /usr/ports/lang/ directory on your FreeBSD
box.

This port tries to autoconfigure itself by looking known libraries in your
system. You can force this port to install dependencies :

 WITH_FFMPEG 
  Will install FFMpeg software on your system and link pike with it

 WITH_TTF
  Will install FreeType1 on your system and link pike with it. 
  This is usefull for example if you use Caudium with it.

 WITH_FREETYPE
  Will install FreeType2 on your system.

 WITH_MYSQL
  Will install Mysql Client libraries and headers.

 WITH_POSTGRES
  Will install Postgres7.2 clients libraries and headers.

 WITH_MSQL
  Will install Msql database (not fully tested).

 WITH_UNIXODBC / WITH_IODBC
  Will install unixODBC or iodbc. Note you *cannot* link a pike with
  both libs. You'll have to choose :)

 WITH_SANE
  Will install and link pike against SANE.

 WITH_PDF
  Will install libpdf and libpanda and link pike against it.

 WITH_SVG2
  Will install librsvg2 and add support for it in pike.

 WITH_TDS
  Will install FreeTDS and link pike with it. Usefull for access to sybase
  or MS-SQL database. (Not fully tested).

 WITH_GNOME
  Will install gnome (loooooong time to compile this !) and add GTK / Gnome 
  support with pike.

 WITH_MESA
  Will install Mesa-GL and link pike with it.

Other things :

 WITH_OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS
  Will use -O3 for x86 arch and add -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer

 WITH_EXPIREMENTAL_FEATURES
  Will enable some experimental features of Pike. Use at your own risk.
  Features enabled :
    --with-computed-goto, --with-keypair-loop, --with-new-multisets

 WITHOUT_RELOCATABLE_DUMPED_MODULES
  Will compile pike with : --without-relocatable-dumped-modules

 WITH_MOST
  Same as WITH_TTF=yes and WITH_FREETYPE=yes

How to use it:

 As root :
 
 # cd /usr/port/lang/pike74
 # make WITH_MOST=yes WITH_MYSQL=yes install clean

 And you will have a pike installed :)
